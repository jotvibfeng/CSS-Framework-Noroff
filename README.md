Github Porject: https://github.com/users/jotvibfeng/projects/1

In this project, I will be using the following technologies: Javascript, HTML, CSS Tailwind. To make a simple social website that you can interact with athor student in noroff whit. The user will be able to add post, delete post from there feed, and edit there post to.

I first started by creating the basic structure of the website. I created the HTML file and added the basic structure of the website. I then added tailwind and added the basic styling to the website. I then added the Javascript file and added the basic functionality with use of API and creating a JWT authorization key to be able to logg in and make a user. I started with make in the loggin function and registartion which was hard at beggining to understand but after some time I got the hang of it after see the video form the moduel. And after that I did the feed page on my site where you can see all the post that you have made and you can delete and edit them. I also added a function to add a post to the feed. I also added a function to edit the post and delete the post. I also added a function to log out of the website.

I have learned a lot from this project. I have learned how to use API and how to create a JWT authorization key. I have also learned how to create a login and registration form. I have also learned how to create a feed page where you can see all the post that you have made and you can delete and edit them. I have also learned how to add a post to the feed. I have also learned how to edit the post and delete the post. I have also learned how to log out of the website.
